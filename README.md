## Dark Souls Cheat Sheet

The following is a checklist and set of information I use when playing Dark Souls to make sure I don't miss an item, conversation or boss. I hope you find it useful. A big thanks goes out to the community of contributors on the Dark Souls Wiki where some of this information is borrowed from. If this is your first time visiting this page please check out the Help section.
